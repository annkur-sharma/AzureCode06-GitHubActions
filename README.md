# AzureCode01-InfraSetup
AzureCode01-InfraSetup - To setup RG, Vnet, Subnet, NIC, NSG, Public IP, VM by dynacally providing resource group name.

## Step 01 - Update backend configuration in the below mentioned file.
#### ✅ Update the values to be used to backend configuration.
#### ⚠️ This is a pre-requisite to execute the code.
#### ❌ If the below resources are not present in the Azure Cloud, the terraform code will ❌ FAIL.
````yaml
📝 .\INFRA01\backend-config-infra01.hcl

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ✅ Update the values to be used to backend configuration.
# ⚠️ This is pre-requisite to execute the code.
# ❌ If the below resources are not present in the Azure Cloud, the terraform code will ❌ FAIL.

resource_group_name  = <ENTER backend - Resource Group>          # Example: "rg-backend"
storage_account_name = <ENTER backend - Storage Account>         # Example: "storageaccount"
container_name       = <ENTER backend - Storage Container Name>  # Example: "storagecontainer"
key                  = <ENTER backend - State File Name>         # Example: "a.terraform.tfstate"
````

## Step 02 - Update azure subscription id in the below mentioned file.
#### ✅ Update this with your own subscription ID.
````yaml
📝 infra01.auto.tfvars

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ✅ Update this with your own subscription ID.
main_provider_subscription_id = "00000000-0000-0000-00000000"
````

## Step 03 - Update variables in the below mentioned file.
#### All variables like Resource Group Location, VNet Address, Subnet Address needs to be updated.
````yaml
📝 infra01.auto.tfvars

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ✅ Update this with your own Azure region.
root_resource_location        = "East US"

# ✅ Update this with your own VNet address space.
root_vnet_address_space       = ["46.87.0.0/24"]

# ✅ Update this with your own subnet address prefixes.
root_subnet_address_prefixes  = ["46.87.0.0/28"]
````

## Step 04 - Following command needs to be executed to initialize the backend.
#### ✅ Run with -backend-config parameter, else the initialize will ask for user input.
````yaml
terraform init -backend-config='backend-config-infra01.hcl'
````

## Step 05 - Following commands can be used to proceed with infrastructure creation.
````yaml
terraform validate
terraform plan
````

## Step 06 - ❌ DO Not run terraform apply with auto-approve as user input is needed for user prefix.
#### ✅ Only run terrafom apply, as user input is need for dynamically creating resource names.
````yaml
terraform apply

# ❌ Do Not run terraform apply -auto-approve
````


# Execution
### On running 'terraform apply', user is asked to provide a prefix of 8 alphanumeric characters.
````yaml
PS D:\TerraformCode\AzureCode01-InfraSetup\INFRA01> terraform apply

Acquiring state lock. This may take a few moments...

var.user_prefix
  Enter an 8-character alphanumeric prefix for the resource names.
  ✅ Example Valid Inputs:
   >> lion1234 ✅ (valid)
   >> eagle987 ✅ (valid)

   ❌ Invalid Inputs:
   >> 123abcdz  ❌ (starts with a number)
   >> abc123    ❌ (less than 8 characters)
   >> abcdefgh9 ❌ (too long)

  Enter a value: lion9876  # ✅ User enters 8 character alphanumeric value
````

# Output
### 📤 Output values displayed to user after successful execution of the code.
````yaml
Apply complete! Resources: 8 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

root_output_virtual_machine_password = "lion9876-Pass1@"  # ⚠️ For training purpose only.   #	❌ Not recommended to use a hardcoded password in production. 🔐
root_output_virtual_machine_username = "lion9876-User1"   # ⚠️ For training purpose only.   #	❌ Not recommended to use a hardcoded username in production. 🔐
root_output_public_ip = "17.x.x.x"                        # ⚠️ For information purpose only.
root_output_resource_group_name = "rg-lion9876"           # ✅ Resource group created with 'rg-' as prefix and user input as suffix.
root_output_virtual_machine = "lion9876-VM"               # ✅ Virtual Machine user input as prefix and '-VM' as suffix.
